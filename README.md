# MetroCard
A mod for Balatro that adds some jokers, with an emphasis on matching the vibe of the original game and creating more jokers with unique/non-scoring-related effects.

## Current Jokers

**Constable**: Disables Joker to the left.

**Grim Reaper**: When blind is selected, add 5 previously destroyed cards to hand. They are Negative.

**Traffic Light**: Switches between Green Light, Yellow Light, and Red Light.

- *Green Light*: 1 in 4 chance to become Yellow Light when a played card scores.
    
- *Yellow Light*: Retrigger next card used in scoring 4 additional times, then become Red Light.
    
- *Red Light*: Debuff next played card used in scoring, then become Green Light.
    
**Metro Card**: Click to load cash. Whenever a card is drawn, draw a Face Card if able and spend $1 of loaded cash.

**Protanopia**: Red Seals and Gold Seals count as each other. Blue Seals and Purple Seals count as each other.

**Jack-O-Lantern**: Each Jack held in hand gives +10 chips per destroyed card.
